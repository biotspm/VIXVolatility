@article{andersen2008,
abstract = {The notion of model-free implied volatility (MFIV), constituting the basis for the highly publicized VIX volatility index, can be hard to measure with accuracy due to the lack of precise prices for options with strikes in the tails of the return distribution. This is reflected in practice as the VIX index is computed through a tail-truncation which renders it more compatible with the related concept of corridor implied volatility (CIV). We provide a comprehensive derivation of the CIV measure and relate it to MFIV under general assumptions. In addition, we price the various volatility contracts, and hence estimate the corresponding volatility measures, under the standard Black-Scholes model. Finally, we undertake the first empirical exploration of the CIV measures in the literature. Our results indicate that the measure can help us refine and systematize the information embedded in the derivatives markets. As such, the CIV measure may serve as a tool to facilitate empirical analysis of both volatility forecasting and volatility risk pricing across distinct future states of the world for diverse asset categories and time horizons.},

This volatility cascade leads to a simple AR-type model in the realized volatility with the feature of considering different volatility components realized over different time horizons and thus termed Heterogeneous Autoregressive model of Realized Volatility (HAR-RV). In spite of the simplicity of its structure and the absence of true long-memory properties , simulation results show that the HAR-RV model successfully achieves the purpose of reproducing the main empirical features of financial returns (long memory, fat tails, and self-similarity) in a very tractable and parsimonious way. Moreover, empirical results show remarkably good forecasting performance.},

This paper compares the information content of the implied volatilities from call options on the S{\&}P 100 index to GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) and Exponential GARCH models of conditional volatility. By adding the implied volatility to GARCH and EGARCH models as an exogenous variable, the within-sample incremental information content of implied volatilities can be examined using a likelihood ratio test of several nested models for conditional volatility. The out-of-sample predictive content of these models is also examined by regressing ex post volatility on the implied volatilities and the forecasts from GARCH and EGARCH models. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

@article{engle2012a,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new intraday volatility forecasting model, particularly suitable for modeling a large number of assets. We decompose volatility of high-frequency returns into components that may be easily interpreted and estimated. The conditional variance is a product of daily, diurnal, and stochastic intraday components. This model is applied to a comprehensive sample consisting of 10-minute returns on more than 2500 US equities. Apart from building a new model, we obtain several interesting forecasting results. We apply a number of different specifications. We estimate models for separate companies, pool data into industries, and consider other criteria for grouping returns. In general, forecasts from pooled cross-section of companies outperform the corresponding forecasts from company-by-company estimation. For less liquid stocks, however, we obtain better forecasts when we group less frequently traded companies together. (JEL: C22, C51, C53, G15)},

@article{kambouroudis2015,
abstract = {This paper investigates the information content of implied volatility forecasts in the context of forecasting stock index return volatility by studying a number of US and European indices. Using a number of different autoregressive models for forecasting implied volatility, we examine whether implied volatility forecasts contain any additional information useful to predict future volatility beyond that embedded in GARCH models and realized volatility. The results show that implied volatility follows a predictable pattern and confirms previous literature that there is a contemporaneous relationship between implied volatility and index returns. When the predictive power of the implied volatility for future volatility is assessed, it is found that, overall, implied volatility contains additional information compared to GARCH and realized volatility, although individually performs worse. Nevertheless, a model that combines the information contained in an asymmetric GARCH model with the information from option markets and realized volatility through (asymmetric) ARMA models is the most appropriate for predicting future volatility. This evidence is also supported in the context of value-at-risk.},
