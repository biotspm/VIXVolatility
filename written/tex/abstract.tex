This paper investigates the information content of model-free implied volatility for daily realized volatility of the S\&P 500, using the VIX from the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. In contrast to the Black-and-Scholes implied volatility, the VIX is not based on any specific option pricing model and therefore does not suffer from the joint hypothesis problem and provides a direct test for market efficiency. Using the approach from an HAR-RV model as described by \textcite{corsi2009} to account for the multi-scaling observed  in financial data, the paper conducts an encompassing regression analysis to address the research question. The results show, that the VIX subsumes all the information contained in historic volatility. This results are be consistent and robust to serial correlation.
