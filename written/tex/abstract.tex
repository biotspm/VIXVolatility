This paper investigates the information content of model-free implied volatility for daily realized volatility of the S\&P 500, using the \ac{VIX} from the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. The data set contains daily volatilities from 2000 to 2017. In contrast to the Black-and-Scholes implied volatility, the VIX is not based on any specific option pricing model, therefore it provides a direct test of market efficiency and does not suffer from the joint hypothesis problem. This paper examines information content of the VIX in comparison to historic volatility. The approach from an HAR-RV model as described by \textcite{corsi2009} is used, thus including not only daily, but also weekly and monthly historic volatility in the encompassing regression analysis. The results show, that the VIX provides additional information compared to historic volatility, but is not able to subsume all the information contained in historic volatilities, which partly contradicts previous research. This results are robust to serial correlation and alternative sampling methods.
