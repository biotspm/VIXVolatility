This paper investigates the information content of model-free implied volatility for daily realized volatility of the S\&P 500, using the VIX from the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. In contrast to the Black-and-Scholes implied volatility, the VIX is not based on any specific option pricing model, therefore it provides a direct test of market efficiency and does not suffer from the joint hypothesis problem. Using the approach from an HAR-RV model as described by \textcite{corsi2009} to account for the multi-scaling observed  in financial data, the paper conducts an encompassing regression analysis to address the research question. The results show, that the VIX provides additional information compared to historic volatility, but is not able to subsume all the information contained in historic volatility. This results are robust to serial correlation and alternative estimation methods.
