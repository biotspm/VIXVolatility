THE JOINT DISTRIBUTIONAL characteristics of asset returns are pivotal for many
issues in financial economics. They are the \textbf{key ingredients for the pricing of
financial instruments}, and they speak directly to the risk-return tradeoff central
to portfolio allocation, performance evaluation, and managerial decision-making. 
fractiles of conditional portfolio
return distributions, which govern the likelihood of extreme shifts in portfolio
value and are therefore central to financial risk management, figuring promi-nently in both regulatory and private-sector initiatives. The most critical feature of the conditional return distribution is arguably itssecond moment structure, which is empirically the dominant time-varying char-acteristic of the distribution. \parencite{andersen2018}.
